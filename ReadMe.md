FireFox Customized Theme
---

Yet, just another fully customized theme for Firefox.


#### How to install
1. location your profile folder location.
> By click **Help -> More Troubleshooting information**, and then find **Profile Folder** row and click **Open Folder**.
2. Then open a terminal here, no matter powershell or bash, zsh, only if you have a git command.
3. Use `git clone https://github.com/MOSconfig/oh-my-firefox.git chrome` to download this new theme.
4. Open **about:config** and mark `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to true.
5. Restart your Firefox and enjoy.


#### Why doing this
I like Firefox much more than Edge or Chrome, while it can let me fully customize my browser, makes me feel control everything.

Edge or Chrome never lets me increase the font size of a tab title. That sucks.
